# SignInterpreter

## Summary

This project would provide an efficient sign interpreter through your camera device. Our first goal consists of developing the classic game "Rock, paper, scissors", thanks to the framework
mediapipe which benefits from machine learning to recognise hand's gestures and convert them to a message.

Once we accomplish this objetive, we want to escalate our project for being able to recognise sign language and display the message on the screen in real time. This would be an
awesome tool for people who are unable to use verbal communication to make themself understood easier.

## Dataset
The dataset has been created by us, using mediapipe and opencv, capturing the images of both hands and storing them which its matching label.
